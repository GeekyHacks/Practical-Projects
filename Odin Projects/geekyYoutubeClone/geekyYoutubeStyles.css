/* 
The asterisk * is a CSS selector that selects all HTML tags on our page.
 We set their margin and padding to 0. We then set their box-sizing
  to border-box. Why do we do that?
We want width or height, border, margin, and padding to add up to be the total
 length. This is what I mean: in CSS, if a box has width of 100px and padding 
 of 10px, the width of the box will now be 110px
But we don't want that – we want everything to be 100px. 
Width should still be 100px including the margin of 10px instead of 
making it 110px. That is what box-sizing: border-box does. */
